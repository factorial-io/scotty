CONFIRMED**\n\n### Confirmed Network Call on Every Request\n\nThe `validate_oidc_token` implementation (device_flow.rs:221-256) makes an HTTP request to the OIDC provider's `/oauth/userinfo` endpoint on EVERY validation:\n\n```rust\npub async fn validate_oidc_token(\u0026self, access_token: \u0026str) -\u003e Result\u003cOidcUser, OAuthError\u003e {\n    let user_url = format!(\"{}/oauth/userinfo\", self.oidc_issuer_url);\n    let response = self\n        .http_client\n        .inner()\n        .get(\u0026user_url)              // ❌ HTTP GET on every request\n        .bearer_auth(access_token)\n        .send()\n        .await?;\n    \n    // Parse and return user info\n}\n```\n\n### Call Sites - Every Authenticated Request\n\n1. **auth_core.rs:151** - Called on EVERY OAuth-authenticated API request\n2. **handlers.rs:113** - Device flow token exchange (less frequent, acceptable)\n3. **handlers.rs:423** - Web flow callback (once per flow, acceptable)\n\n### Performance Impact Calculation\n\n**Without caching**:\n- 1 API request = 1 OIDC validation = 1 network roundtrip (100-500ms)\n- 100 requests/sec = 100 validations/sec\n- 1000 requests/sec = 1000 validations/sec → rate limit territory\n\n**With caching (1 hour TTL)**:\n- First request with token = 1 validation (cache miss)\n- Next 3600 seconds of requests = 0 validations (cache hits)\n- 1000 requests/sec ≈ 0.3 validations/sec (assuming user sessions)\n\n**Cache hit ratio estimate**:\n- Average user session: 30 minutes\n- API calls per session: 100-1000\n- Expected cache hit rate: 99%+\n\n### Real-World Latency Impact\n\nWithout cache:\n```\nAPI Request → Auth Check (150ms OIDC) → Handler (50ms) = 200ms total\n```\n\nWith cache (hit):\n```\nAPI Request → Auth Check (0.1ms cache) → Handler (50ms) = 50ms total\n```\n\n**4x latency improvement** for authenticated requests.\n\n### OIDC Provider Constraints\n\n**GitLab** (common OIDC provider):\n- Rate limit: 600 requests/min per IP\n- Without cache: 10 req/sec max per instance\n- With cache: Effectively unlimited\n\n**Keycloak**:\n- Default: 30 requests/sec per realm\n- Without cache: Cannot scale beyond 30 req/sec\n- With cache: Unlimited API throughput\n\n### Security Trade-offs\n\n**Concern**: Cached tokens continue working after revocation\n\n**Mitigation strategies**:\n\n1. **Short TTL** (recommended: 5-15 minutes)\n   - Balance: performance vs revocation latency\n   - 5 min = max 5 min delay on token revocation\n   - Still 99%+ cache hit rate\n\n2. **Token revocation list** (optional enhancement)\n   ```rust\n   struct TokenCache {\n       cache: HashMap\u003cString, CachedToken\u003e,\n       revoked: HashSet\u003cString\u003e,  // Explicitly revoked tokens\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **JTI-based caching** (best practice)\n   - Cache by JWT ID (jti) instead of full token\n   - Smaller memory footprint\n   - Same security properties\n\n### Memory Usage Estimate\n\n**Per cached token**:\n- Token string: ~500 bytes (JWT)\n- User info: ~200 bytes\n- Metadata: ~50 bytes\n- **Total: ~750 bytes/token**\n\n**Capacity**:\n- 1000 active users = 750 KB\n- 10000 active users = 7.5 MB\n- 100000 active users = 75 MB\n\n**With cleanup**: Old tokens removed every 5 minutes, memory stable.\n\n### Implementation Priority\n\n**Priority 2 (Medium)** is appropriate because:\n- Impacts performance, not security\n- Workaround: Scale horizontally (but expensive)\n- Should fix before production at scale\n- Not blocking MVP deployment\n\n### Recommended Configuration\n\n```yaml\napi:\n  oauth:\n    token_cache_enabled: true\n    token_cache_ttl_seconds: 300        # 5 minutes (security-performance balance)\n    token_cache_max_size: 10000         # Prevent unbounded growth\n    token_cache_cleanup_interval: 300   # 5 minutes\n```\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Token Cache Cleanup Required\n\n**DO NOT FORGET**: Token cache cleanup is **mandatory** to prevent memory leak!\n\n### Why Cleanup Is Critical\n\nWithout periodic cleanup, the token cache will accumulate expired entries indefinitely, creating a memory leak similar to scotty-37 (OAuth session leak).\n\n**Memory leak scenario**:\n1. Tokens expire after TTL (e.g., 5 minutes)\n2. Expired tokens remain in HashMap\n3. New tokens added continuously\n4. Cache grows unbounded → OOM crash\n\n### Required Cleanup Implementation\n\n**1. Background cleanup task** (spawn on startup):\n```rust\n// In app initialization\ntokio::spawn(async move {\n    let mut interval = tokio::time::interval(Duration::from_secs(300)); // 5 minutes\n    loop {\n        interval.tick().await;\n        token_cache.cleanup_expired().await;\n        \n        // Log cleanup stats\n        let size = token_cache.size().await;\n        debug!(\"Token cache cleanup completed, current size: {}\", size);\n    }\n});\n```\n\n**2. Passive cleanup** (on access):\n```rust\npub async fn validate_with_cache(\u0026self, token: \u0026str) -\u003e Result\u003cOidcUser\u003e {\n    // Check cache\n    if let Some(cached) = self.cache.read().await.get(token) {\n        if Instant::now() \u003c cached.expires_at {\n            return Ok(cached.user.clone());\n        }\n        // Expired - remove immediately (passive cleanup)\n        self.cache.write().await.remove(token);\n    }\n    \n    // Validate and cache...\n}\n```\n\n**3. Size-based eviction** (LRU for safety):\n```rust\nconst MAX_CACHE_SIZE: usize = 10_000;\n\nasync fn insert_with_limit(\u0026mut self, token: String, cached: CachedToken) {\n    if self.cache.len() \u003e= MAX_CACHE_SIZE {\n        // Evict oldest entry (LRU)\n        if let Some(oldest_key) = self.find_oldest_entry() {\n            self.cache.remove(\u0026oldest_key);\n            warn!(\"Token cache size limit reached, evicted oldest entry\");\n        }\n    }\n    self.cache.insert(token, cached);\n}\n```\n\n### Cleanup Verification\n\n**Add metrics** (scotty-41 integration):\n- `oauth_token_cache_size` - Current cache size\n- `oauth_token_cache_cleanup_count` - Tokens removed per cleanup\n- `oauth_token_cache_evictions` - Size-based evictions\n\n**Add alerts**:\n```yaml\n- alert: TokenCacheGrowingUnbounded\n  expr: oauth_token_cache_size \u003e 50000\n  for: 10m\n  annotations:\n    summary: \"Token cache cleanup may not be working\"\n```\n\n### Testing Checklist\n\n- [ ] Cleanup task spawned on startup\n- [ ] Expired tokens removed by background task\n- [ ] Passive cleanup on access works\n- [ ] Size limit enforced (LRU eviction)\n- [ ] Metrics track cache size over time\n- [ ] Load test confirms stable memory usage\n- [ ] No memory growth over 24-hour period\n\n### Relationship to scotty-37\n\nThis issue is similar to scotty-37 (OAuth session cleanup):\n- Same pattern: HashMap without cleanup → memory leak\n- Same solution: Background cleanup task + metrics\n- **Must not repeat the same mistake!**\n\n**Learn from scotty-37**: Any in-memory cache with TTL **requires** cleanup.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-27T01:27:25.523931+01:00","updated_at":"2025-10-27T01:29:42.036307+01:00","labels":["caching","oauth","performance","scalability"]}
