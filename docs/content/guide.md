# A guide to Scotty


## What is Scotty?

Scotty is a so-called *Micro-Platform-as-a-Service*. It allows you to **manage** all your
docker-compose-based apps with **a simple UI and CLI**. Scotty provides a simple
REST API so you can interact with your apps. It takes care of the lifetime
of your apps and adds basic auth to prevent unauthorized access if needed and
instructs robots to not index your apps.

The primary use-case is to **host ephemeral review apps** for your projects. It
should be relatively easy to integrate Scotty into existing workflows,
e.g. with CI/CD pipelines or run it on a case-by-case basis from your local.

Scotty is **a very simple orchestrator** for your docker-compose-based apps. The UI
is designed to be simple and easy to use, so people other than devs can restart
a stopped app or check the status of an app.

If you **can write a docker-compose-based app** which runs on your local, then
Scotty **should be able to "beam"** that app to a server **and run it there**, with a
nice domain name, so you can reach it from the internet.

## What is Scotty not?

It's not a solution for production-grade deployments. It's not a replacement for
tools like Nomad, Kubernetes or OpenShift. If you need fine-grained control on
how your apps are executed, Scotty might not be the right tool for you.
It does not orchestrate your apps on a cluster of machines.
It's a single-node solution, with limited access control and no support for
scaling your apps.

It is also not a replacement for tools like Dockyard or Portainer. You
will still need to log into the server and use the CLI to debug malfunctioning
applications or inspect the logs.

Scotty wants to be a simple solution for a simple use-case.
